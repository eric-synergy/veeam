10. From the Guest OS Credentials dropdown box, choose the Domain Administrator (veeamlab\administrator).. 

11. Click on the "Applications" button.  Select Tiny-Veeam from the list and click Edit.
    
12. Select the Disable application processing radio button. Click OK. And then click OK again. 
    
    Tiny-Veeam is a linux VM so it does not have VSS framework on it, therefore we choose to disable application-aware image processing for this VM.

13. Click Test Now and watch the test complete. Notice that Tiny-Veeam fails guest credentials. That's to be expected and is ok.  

14. Click Close as the testing completes.

15. Click Next to proceed.

16. Schedule this job to run daily. Click APPLY to proceed.
    There is no option to schedule the automatic retry for jobs configured to start only manually. 

17. Click Finish
    
18. Click Finish. Feel free to review the job by right clicking and selecting Edit. To keep the lab cleaned up for others, please delete your job when youâ€™re done.
